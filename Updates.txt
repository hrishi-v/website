JavaScript resource::

To best simulate a industry-standard development workflow, we are using a GitHub repository to both keep each other updated on progress, 
and staying motivated. In addition to this, I have created a Markdown file including important syntax and techniques to employ in JavaScript, 
as a mean to refresh myself before moving onto learning React. This is something that I can share once the project is more fleshed out, 
in a future post.

Developing the Register and Login webpages::

This was the first hiccup that I came across, wherein I was experimenting with the React Router module, where I was aiming to make the 
Register button redirect me to the Login page - a very primitive task, with no actual checks for password length, valid emails etc.
Wrapping the root.render in the main.jsx file, would cause the Login page to disappear, need a method to select a landing page. I
resolved  this by utilising the React Router library and assigning paths to each webpage created.

The next major dilemma I had was whether or not to use the Navbar from the React Bootstrap library. At first, I developed the webpages with the Navbar,
but found that it was restrictive in regards to appearance and customizability, so I moved to a navbar constructed from scratch HTML and CSS, allowing
for more creative control, as well as an opportunity to learn HTML and CSS concepts.
